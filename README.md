Task:
-----
Build a Todo list as a mini front-end application to satisfy the provided user stories.

User Stories:
-------------
```
As a forgetful person
I want to store my tasks
So that I don't forget them

As a person with limited time
I want to instantly be able to update my todo list (adding and changing entries)
So that I have more time to think about other things

As a person who actually gets stuff done
I want to mark my tasks as done
So that I don't do them twice

**Bonus:**

As a person with a lot of tasks
I want to be able to filter my tasks by "All", "Active", "Complete"
So that I only see the relevant tasks

As a person who doesn't like counting by hand
I want to see a total number of tasks
So that I don't have to count

As someone who has done lots of stuff
I want to be able to clear my completed tasks
So I never see them again
```

Aims:
-----
* Well written, well structured acceptance and unit tests
* Clear and expressive JavaScript
* Good HTML5 markup and CSS
* Deploy the Node.js app to Heroku
